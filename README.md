# LLM CTF Automation Framework

This repository holds the baseline automation framework for evaluation on the [NYU CTF Bench](nyu-llm-ctf.github.io).
It implements an LLM Agent that operates in a docker environment and interacts with CTF challenges to solve them.

## Installation and Setup

The setup requires docker to be installed on the system, please follow instructions for your OS.
The code is tested with atleast python 3.10, earlier versions may work but it is not tested.
It is recommended to create a virtualenv or conda environment for this setup.

Follow these instructions to setup:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation`
2. `cd llm_ctf_automation`
3. Install python dependencies: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the setup script to build the docker image and create the network: `./setup.sh`
5. Download the dataset (will take a few minutes): `python3 -m nyuctf.download`
